VERBER 

This plugin's main function is to add a reverb effect, with the added benefit of dynamic ducking. This eliminates the need for sidechain compression on the audio bus and has been very helpful to me in achieving a well-spaced reverb effect quickly.

Verber is available as VST3 and AU for Windows and Mac architecture.
